  abstract = {Container-based virtualization is a popular technique, e.g., to realize microservice architectures. Recently, containers became popular in Industry 4.0 / IIoT systems, which typically consist of hundreds of (edge) devices and machines. In such setups, efficient management of containers is essential as offered by container orchestrators like Kubernetes. However, currently no specific overviews discussing orchestrator capabilities for Industry 4.0 are available. In this paper, we analyze nine open source container orchestrators for their application in Industry~4.0 or IIoT settings as a basis for future research and development. We contribute a systematic literature review to identify 23 basic orchestration requirements. We complement this by insights from an intensive requirements collection in a research project on intelligent industrial production, as well as selected features from a published generic orchestrator analysis. From these 66 requirements, we derive a requirements/feature taxonomy, which we use to analyze the nine open source orchestrators including Kubernetes. We show that there is, e.g., still a lack of support regarding edge devices, IIoT protocols, security mechanisms, and specialized resources for artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Containers emerged as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines that offer better microservice architecture support. They are widely used by organizations to deploy their increasingly diverse workloads derived from modern applications such as big data, IoT, and edge/fog computing in either proprietary clusters or private, public cloud data centers. With the growing interest in container-based virtualization technologies, the requirement to explore the deployment and orchestration of clusters of containers has become a central research problem. Although progress has been made to study containerization, systematic consolidation of the existing literature with a summative evaluation is still missing. To fill this gap, in this paper, we first taxonomically classify the existing research studies on the performance comparison between hypervisor and container technology and then analyze state-of-the-art for container cluster management orchestration systems, its performance monitoring tools, and finally future research trends. This results in a better understanding of container technology with attention to provide summative analysis in terms of (i) how much performance overhead is generated by a hypervisor compared to container-based virtualization, (ii) which container technology is suited for a cloud application deployment based on the type of benchmark executing, (iii) how to provide management of containers deployed in a cluster environment, (iv) container performance monitoring tools, and (v) finally emerging concerns for future research directions.},

To enable the usage of container orchestration in resource-constrained environments, lightweight distributions emerged. The platforms MicroK8s (mK8s) and K3s, which are analyzed in this paper, claim to provide an easy deployment of K8s in a simplified form and way. In terms of resource utilization and deployment time of a K8s cluster, the lightweight platforms promise savings compared to K8s. We analyzed lightweight K8s distributions in a quantitative way by performing an experiment that monitors the utilization and time consumption compared to a native K8s cluster lifecycle. This involves starting, stopping, and adding nodes as well as creating, running, and deleting deployments. We show that not all platforms exhibit a quantitative advantage over K8s. K3s caused a similar resource consumption but had some performance advantages for starting new nodes and adding nodes to the cluster. The platform MicroK8s has shown a higher resource utilization and time consumption for all steps in our modeled lifecycle simulation. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

  abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized the deployment of innovative services, with cloud-native applications becoming a fundamental design pattern. Kubernetes has emerged as the leading platform for container and application management in this paradigm. For telecommunication companies (Telcos) with numerous edge sites, adopting cloud-native solutions offers the potential for rapid deployment, configuration, and maintenance of network applications, while ensuring a robust certification process.    However, this shift requires a certified, modular, and extensible framework to manage multiple edge sites along with their associated Network Functions and services. The Sylva Project aims to provide such a framework, offering a reference implementation based on open-source software tailored to European Telcos' needs. Sylva seeks to automate and standardize the traditionally manual and fragmented process of deploying and managing edge sites with bare-metal or virtualized nodes.    The automation of bare-metal Sylva deployments presents a unique challenge, requiring deep, domain-specific knowledge of the underlying infrastructure. This thesis proposes an architecture based on the Server Operator and its related Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).    An important component of this solution is to seamlessly integrate within the existing stack, while following the patterns and standards of Kubernetes and the tools used within Sylva. This is achieved by extending Sylva's current operators to simplify the configuration of bare-metal nodes. By doing so, the proposed architecture aims to enhance collaboration between infrastructure administrators and application developers, ultimately increasing deployment agility in Telco environments.},

Governments and companies are both striving to identify the most effective measures to increase energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. Based on results of a recent EU-funded roadmapping project, this paper highlights the needs of industrial companies for integrating energy efficiency performance in production management. First, it analyses concepts and tools for measurement, control and improvement of energy efficiency in production management proposed in literature. Second, the paper outlines that ICT tools and standardization are important enablers for energy efficient manufacturing. Third, industrial needs in these areas are presented based on expert interviews. The industrial needs thus identified are contrasted with concepts proposed in literature to point out the implementation gaps between practice and theory. The paper demonstrates that there exists a gap between the solutions available and the actual implementation in industrial companies. It concludes by deriving requirements for energy management in production that future collaborative research projects should address.},

  abstract = {In the last years cloud computing is becoming more and more important for companies. They start developing their applications to be cloud-native, composed by a bunch of containerized micro-services cooperating each other in order to exploit the horizontal scalability capabilities. Having many containers require a component able to manage their life cycle: the widely used solution is Kubernetes.  More and more companies are interested in diversifying their cloud infrastructure in two main ways: multi-cloud, that is having clusters at different public cloud providers, or hybrid cloud, an owned physical data center and a virtual infrastructure at one or more cloud providers. Diversifying the infrastructure allows to increase resiliency, to be present on different geographical regions, to avoid lock-in to a single provider and gives the opportunity of saving costs.  The last point is what this thesis wants to investigate. How can we exploit that kind of infrastructures optimizing costs?  Public cloud clusters are elastic: the number of nodes can increase and decrease in time to adapt their overall capacity to the actual workload in execution. This has to be kept into consideration when modeling their costs.  Knowing how Kubernetes cluster costs are structured can be very useful for many reasons: for teams to increase awareness on how much are spending, to compare what cloud provider is more convenient for some requirements, to estimate the costs of having a private datacenter and comparing it to having virtual infrastructures.  Cloud providers bills, unfortunately, does not give at all details on how costs are distributed, so having a model can make them more clear.  An effort has been made on modeling container costs since they are the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes. Two kind of models have been defined: the overall Kubernetes cluster cost model (one for the public cloud, one for the private cloud) and the container cost model.  The knowledge of the container cost model has been then applied to a multi-cluster scheduling scenario to increase the cost efficiency of the container distribution among the clusters thanks to their cost information.},

However, the cooperation of several services leads to intricate dependencies, hindering the detection of performance bottlenecks. Current microservice performance analysis methods require real deployments, a costly process both in time and resources, while performance prediction through simulation relies on models that are complex to develop and instantiate. In this paper, we propose a microservice performance analysis approach based on simulation. Our contribution first introduces a microservice performance model requiring few instantiation parameters. We then propose a methodology to automatically derive model instantiation values from a single execution trace. We evaluate this methodology on two benchmarks from the literature. Our approach accurately predicts the deployment performance of large-scale microservice applications in various configurations from a single execution trace. This provides valuable insights on the performance of an application prior to its deployment on real platform.},

First, the article discusses why and how chaos engineering is promising to improve the resilience of DTs. Then, it identifies and introduces a set of chaos engineering profiles specifically designed to take into account the many aspects an industrial environment is composed of. Finally, it shows the feasibility of assessing the resilience of a proof-of-concept DT through a testbed based on widely-adopted, open-source tools.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing can be defined as the use of new or existing computing hardware and virtualization technologies to form a shared infrastructure that enables web-based value added services. The three predominant service models are infrastructure, platform, and software-asa-service. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) can be defined as the use of servers, storage, and virtualization to enable utility like services for users. Security is a big concern within IaaS, especially considering that the rest of the cloud service models run on top of the infrastructure and related layers. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers offer access to APIs, programming languages and development middleware which allows subscribers to develop custom applications without installing or configuring the development environment. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) gives subscribed or pay-peruse users access to software or services which reside in the cloud and not on the user's device. Understanding the cloud service models is critical in determining if cloud services or hosting are an appropriate business solution, and if so, which model best balances the level of control required versus reduced hardware, configuration, and maintenance costs. Cloud computing offers many benefits to organizations; it has enabled collaboration amongst disparate communities and workgroups, and has overcome challenges that have plagued existing business solutions. However, the security, privacy, and integrity of the cloud are of prime importance and there are many challenges that exist. At the present time there seems to be a lot of momentum behind the adoption of cloud computing despite these. This may simply be a trend, an indication that society truly wants their data to be available whenever from anywhere, or a sign that few understand the associated risks.},

  abstract = {Cloud-based architectures are advantageous in aspects such as scalability, reliability and resource utilization efficiency, to name just a few, thus being considered one of the pillars of Industry 4.0. However, in this domain, cloud computing platforms are subject to specific requirements, namely in what concerns real-time performance, determinism and fault-tolerance. This paper focuses on cloud native computing, which is an emerging and promising cloud-computing paradigm, specifically addressing its applicability to real-time systems. Firstly, it introduces the architecture of cloud native applications, discussing their principles, potential advantages and challenges. Then it addresses the opportunities and constraints of such technologies when applied to industrial real-time systems.},

It is often used for software development when a hardware base is being altered. For example, if a programmer is developing software for some new special purpose (e.g., aerospace) computer X which is under construction and as yet unavailable, he will likely begin by writing a simulator for that computer on some available general-purpose machine G. The simulator will provide a detailed simulation of the special-purpose environment X, including its processor, memory, and I/O devices. Except for possible timing dependencies, programs which run on the “simulated machine X” can later run on the “real machine X” (when it is finally built and checked out) with identical effect. The programs running on X can be arbitrary — including code to exercise simulated I/O devices, move data and instructions anywhere in simulated memory, or execute any instruction of the simulated machine. The simulator provides a layer of software filtering which protects the resources of the machine G from being misused by programs on X.},

  abstract = {Given the recent massive spike in interest in Linux Containers, you could be forgiven for wondering, “Why now?”. It has been argued that the increasingly prevalent cloud computing model more closely resembles hosting providers than traditional enterprise IT, and that containers are a perfect match for this model.Despite the sudden ubiquity of container technology, like so much in the world of open source software, containerization depends on a long series of previous innovations, especially in the operating system. “One cannot resist an idea whose time has come.” Containers are such an idea, one that has been a long time coming.Early DaysThe year 2000 was a busy one in the world of computing. 15 years ago, Bill Gates stood aside for Steve Balmer at Microsoft. The NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5132.52, the beginning of the end for the dot-com boom. The patent on the RSA cryptographic algorithm ended and the last Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) got turned off. And jails, an early implementation of container technology, was added to FreeBSD.In 2001, container technology made it to the Linux side of the house. Jacques Gélinas created the VServer project, which according to the 0.0 version’s change log allowed “running several general purpose Linux server on a single box with a high degree of Independence and security.”The Linux-VServer solution was the first effort on Linux to “separate the user-space environment into distinct units (Virtual Private Servers) in such a way that each VPS looks and feels like a real server to the processes contained within.” And though the Linux-VServer project lacked process migration and clustering, its real weakness was that it required a patched kernel, imposing an additional overhead on distributors and system administrators (or is it a feature?).Incremental InnovationsIt was Paul Menage’s approach in 2006 of adapting the cpusets mechanism already in the mainline kernel that really moved containerization on Linux forward, requiring minimally intrusive changes with little impact on performance, code quality, complexity, and future compatibility.The result was generic process containers, which were later renamed control groups, or cgroups, to reflect the fact that “this code is an important part of a container solution... it's far from the whole thing.” Cgroups allow processes to be grouped together, and ensure that each group gets a share of memory, CPU and disk I/O; preventing any one container from monopolizing any of these resources.Under former Red Hat Linux kernel developer and a principal software engineer Tejun Heo’s stewardship, cgroups underwent a massive redesign, replacing multiple, per-controller cgroup hierarchies with a “single kernel cgroup hierarchy… allow controllers to be individually enabled for each cgroup” and is the “private property of systemd.” These changes, especially when combined with functionality in systemd, increased the consistency and manageability of cgroups.Kernel namespaces are another key part of a container solution, with Red Hatter Eric W. Biederman’s 2008 user namespaces patches being arguably the most complex and one of the most important namespaces in the context of containers. The implementation of user namespaces allows a process to have it’s own set of users and in particular to allows a process root privileges inside a container, but not outside.Security ConcernsThe Linux Containers project (LXC), created by engineers from IBM around 2008, layered some userspace tooling on top of cgroups and namespaces. While the LXC provided an improved user experience around containers, it had some people asking “Are LXC containers enough?”Of particular concern was security, because the “DAC (discretionary access control) system on which LXC relie for all security is known to be incomplete and so it is entirely possible to accidentally/intentionally break out of the container and/or impose a DOS attack on the host OS.”Since the 1.0 release of LXC in early 2014, the situation improved as LXC began leveraging some longstanding Linux security technologies. In addition to security features in cgroups and namespaces, support for SELinux and Seccomp were added.Seccomp is a Linux kernel feature by Red Hat’s Andrea Arcangeli for limiting the system calls which a task can use. The intent was to allow underutilised CPU to be rented out to untrusted guests without fearing they’d abuse other resources, an idea that maps to the container use case.SELinux is the mandatory access control (MAC) system developed by a consortium of companies and government agencies that is really good at “labeling processes, files, and devices at defining rules on how labeled processes interact with labeled processes, files, and devices.” Linux containers, as a group of processes, are a good match for hardening with SELinux.Common Packaging FormatThe genesis of the current Linux Container craze is of course the open source Docker project and associated Docker container format. Docker built on all of the incremental developments that came before it and upped the ante by (originally) wrapping the LXC userspace tools with even easier to use tooling aimed at developers looking for simple ways to package their applications.In June 2015, Docker the company, the largest contributor to Docker the project (Red Hat is the second), donated the project’s existing codebase to the Open Container Initiative, a lightweight governance structure under the auspices of the Linux Foundation created to prevent fragmentation and promote open standards by “cloud giants” including Red Hat. Maintainers of both libcontainer and appc, the donated codebase, form a technical advisory board that will guide and drive the project. Red Hat is proud to have one of our own, Vincent Batts, helping to guide the Initiative’s technical direction.Orchestrating at ScaleOne of the biggest challenges for those working with containers today is how to deploy and orchestrate containers at scale. While a number of approaches are emerging, the one that is gaining the most traction is Kubernetes. When Kubernetes launched in 2014, Google discussed how “everything at Google runs in a container” to support their various service offerings and made news when they revealed that they were starting “over 2 billion containers per week.” Google outlined details on the lineage of the Kubernetes project which is traced from Borg, Google’s internal container cluster-management system.Over the past year, Red Hat has contributed substantially to Kubernetes in various areas, as we work to bring the concepts of atomic, immutable infrastructure to enterprise customers in products like OpenShift, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL Atomic Host. Many of the Google developers that Red Hat collaborates with today in the Kubernetes community were previously developers on the Borg project. As we work with Google and others to bring Kubernetes to enterprise users, we benefit greatly from their experience as they bring the best ideas from Borg into Kubernetes and learn from its shortcomings.Looking AheadDespite the long history of incremental innovations, recent advancements in Linux around Linux containers are revolutionizing the way that companies will develop, consume, and manage applications. As with traditional applications, containerized applications interact with and depend on the operating system.Future innovations in the containerization of applications will build on incremental improvements to the Linux operating system, as they have all along. Red Hat’s container strategy helps IT deliver applications to accelerate business agility, developer productivity, and deployment flexibility across hybrid cloud environments.},

  abstract = {Nowadays the amount of data is being produced exponentially with the rapid development of electronic technology and communication, which makes it hard to cost-effectively store and manage these big data. Cloud computing, a new business model, is considered as one of most attractive solutions for big data, and provides the advantage of reduced cost through sharing of computing and storage resources. However, the growing concerns in term of the privacy of data stored in public cloud have slowed down the adoption of cloud computing for big data because sensitive information may be contained among the big data or the data owner themselves do not want any other people to scan their data. Since the data volume is huge and mobile devices are widely used, the traditional cryptographic approach are not suitable for big data. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for image data, which has much more volume than text data. We evaluate our scheme in real networks (including Amazon EC2), and our experimental results on image show that: (1) our scheme achieves privacy but only use 1/585.8 1/398.6 the time of the AES algorithm; (2) the delay of our hybrid-cloud-based scheme is only 3\% 5\% more than that of the traditional public-cloud-only approach.},

It has traveled from the concept of parallel computing to distributed computing to grid computing and recently to cloud computing. Although the idea of cloud computing has been around for quite some time, it is an emerging field of computer science. Cloud computing can be defined as a computing environment where computing needs by one party can be outsourced to another party and when need be arise to use the computing power or resources like database or emails, they can access them via internet. Cloud computing is a recent trend in IT that moves computing and data away from desktop and portable PCs into large data centers. The main advantage of cloud computing is that customers do not have to pay for infrastructure, its installation, required man power to handle such infrastructure and maintenance. In this paper we will discuss what makes all this possible, what is the architectural design of cloud computing and its applications.},

For understanding and analyzing these implications in an easy, quick, and cost-effective way, we present PerfSim, a discrete-event simulator for approximating and predicting the performance of cloud native service chains in user-defined scenarios. To this end, we proposed a systematic approach for modeling the performance of microservices endpoint functions by collecting and analyzing their performance and network traces. With a combination of the extracted models and user-defined scenarios, PerfSim can then simulate the performance behavior of all services over a given period and provide an approximation for system KPIs, such as requests' average response time. Using the processing power of a single laptop, we evaluated both simulation accuracy and speed of PerfSim in 104 prevalent scenarios and compared the simulation results with the identical deployment in a real Kubernetes cluster. We achieved \textasciitilde 81-99\% simulation accuracy in approximating the average response time of incoming requests and \textasciitilde 16-1200 times speed-up factor for the simulation.},

  abstract = {Serverless computing, especially when deployed at the edge of the network, is seen as an enabling technology for the future development of more complex Internet of Things systems. However, special care must be taken when deploying new edge infrastructures for serverless workloads in terms of resource usage and network connectivity. Inefficient utilization of the available computing resources might easily cancel out the benefits acquired by moving the equipment closer to the edge, namely the reduced communication latency. Containers, together with the Kubernetes container orchestrator, are used by many serverless platforms today. We evaluate the performance of three different Kubernetes distributions—full-fledged Kubernetes, K3s, and MicroK8s when deployed in a resource constrained environment at the edge. We use the OpenFaaS serverless platform and employ 14 different benchmarks divided into three separate categories to evaluate various aspects of the execution performance of the distributions. Four different test types are performed focusing on cold start latency, serial execution performance, parallel execution using a single replica, and parallel execution utilizing different autoscaling strategies. Our results show that the edge-oriented K3s and MicroK8s distributions offer better performance in the majority of the tests, while a full-fledged deployment exhibits noticeable advantages for sustained loads such as parallel function invocation using a single replica.},

Consequently, software vendors have released several lightweight Kubernetes (K8s) distributions for container orchestration in the last few years, but it remains difficult for software developers to select an appropriate solution. Existing studies on lightweight K8s distribution performance tested only small workloads, showed inconclusive results, and did not cover recently released distributions. The contribution of this paper is a comparison of MicroK8s, k3s, k0s, and MicroShift, investigating their minimal resource usage as well as control plane and data plane performance in stress scenarios. While k3s and k0s showed by a small amount the highest control plane throughput and MicroShift showed the highest data plane throughput, usability, security, and maintainability are additional factors that drive the decision for an appropriate distribution.},

Suddenly and in the last years the term is used again more and more frequently and shows increasing momentum. This paper summarizes the outcomes of a systematic mapping study analyzing research papers covering “cloud-native” topics, research questions and engineering methodologies. We summarize research focuses and trends dealing with cloud-native application engineering approaches.

CloudCmp measures the elastic computing, persistent storage, and networking services offered by a cloud along metrics that directly reflect their impact on the performance of customer applications. CloudCmp strives to ensure fairness, representativeness, and compliance of these measurements while limiting measurement cost. Applying CloudCmp to four cloud providers that together account for most of the cloud customers today, we find that their offered services vary widely in performance and costs, underscoring the need for thoughtful provider selection. From case studies on three representative cloud applications, we show that CloudCmp can guide customers in selecting the best-performing provider for their applications.},

  abstract = {Various kinds of engineering software and digitalized equipment are widely applied through the lifecycle of industrial products. As a result, massive data of different types are being produced. However, these data are hysteretic and isolated from each other, leading to low efficiency and low utilization of these valuable data. Simulation based on theoretical and static model has been a conventional and powerful tool for the verification, validation, and optimization of a system in its early planning stage, but no attention is paid to the simulation application during system run-time. With the development of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, more data can be collected, and it is time to find a way for the deep application of all these data. As a result, the concept of digital twin has aroused much concern and is developing rapidly. Dispute and discussions around concepts, paradigms, frameworks, applications, and technologies of digital twin are on the rise both in academic and industrial communities. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection according to the proposed criteria, 240 academic publications about digital twin are identified and classified. This paper conducts a comprehensive and in-depth review of these literatures to analyze digital twin from the perspective of concepts, technologies, and industrial applications. Research status, evolution of the concept, key enabling technologies of three aspects, and fifteen kinds of industrial applications in respective lifecycle phase are demonstrated in detail. Based on this, observations and future work recommendations for digital twin research are presented in the form of different lifecycle phases.},

However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83\% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52\%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.},

While a lot of research is currently taking place in the technology itself, there is an equally urgent need for understanding the business-related issues surrounding cloud computing. In this article, we identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the cloud computing industry. We then identify the various issues that will affect the different stakeholders of cloud computing. We also issue a set of recommendations for the practitioners who will provide and manage this technology. For IS researchers, we outline the different areas of research that need attention so that we are in a position to advice the industry in the years to come. Finally, we outline some of the key issues facing governmental agencies who, due to the unique nature of the technology, will have to become intimately involved in the regulation of cloud computing.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in virtualization and software architectures have led to the birth of the new paradigm of serverless computing. Serverless computing, also known as function-as-a-service, allows developers to deploy functions as computing units without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Moreover, no resources are allocated or billed until a function is invoked. Thus, the major benefits of serverless computing are reduced developer concern about infrastructure, reduced time to market and lower cost. Currently, serverless computing is generally available through various public cloud service providers. However, there are certain bottlenecks on public cloud platforms, such as vendor lock-in, computation restrictions and regulatory restrictions. Thus, there is a growing interest to implement serverless computing on a private infrastructure. One of the preferred ways of implementing serverless computing is through the use of containers. A container-based solution allows to utilize features of existing orchestration frameworks, such as Kubernetes. This thesis discusses the implementation of serverless computing on Kubernetes. To this end, we carry out a feature evaluation of four open source serverless computing frameworks, namely Kubeless, OpenFaaS, Fission and OpenWhisk. Based on predefined criteria, we select Kubeless, Fission and OpenFaaS for further evaluation. First, we describe the developer experience on each framework. Next, we compare three different modes in which OpenFaaS functions are executed: HTTP, serializing and streaming. We evaluate the response time of function invocation and ease of monitoring and management of logs. We find that HTTP mode is the preferred mode for OpenFaaS. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the considered frameworks under different workloads. We find that Kubeless has the best performance among the three frameworks, both in terms of response time and the ratio of successful responses.},

In terms of cloud services, it is achieved by providing and developing services that are platform-dependent with proprietary technologies, interfaces or formats. This can be a huge barrier to adopt cloud services because customers are tied to specific vendors which prevent portability through proprietary or a limited set of interfaces. As consequence, customers are hindered to alternate venders easily without substantial migration costs. A multi-cloud strategy is one possible way to avoid vendor lock-ins. The scope of the is paper is to design and implement a solution-stack to provide web services which operate independent from proprietary cloud service provider technologies. We provide a solution stack prototype which will support key functionalities such as portability, interoperability and platform-independency by implementing modern technologies and standards.},

As such, containers orchestration technologies are becoming indispensable. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard because of its robustness, maturity and rich features. To free users of the burden of having to configure and maintain complex Kubernetes infrastructures, but still make use of its functionalities, all major Cloud providers are now offering cloud-native managed Kubernetes alternatives. The goal of this paper is to investigate the performance of containers running in such hosted services. For this purpose, we conduct a series of experimental evaluations of containers to monitor the behaviour of system resources including CPU, memory, disk and network. A baseline consisting of a manually deployed Kubernetes cluster was built for comparison. In particular, we consider the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The Australia-wide NeCTAR Research Cloud was used for the baseline.},

  abstract = {Chaos Engineering represents an interesting software engineering methodology to improve the resilience of a complex IT system operating in a live production environment by injecting simulated faults, observing the system reaction, and devising mitigating solutions. However, Chaos Engineering is an expensive practice with a high setup and operation overhead and it often focuses on the evaluation of the system behavior from a relatively narrow technical perspective instead of a more comprehensive business level one. To enlarge the audience of Chaos Engineering there is the need for novel solutions that can give service providers the tools to deal with the deployment and testing of complex IT services. To fill this gap, this paper presents ChaosTwin, a novel solution exploring an innovative approach to apply Chaos Engineering to a digital-twin, i.e., a virtual representation of a physical object or a system. By creating realistic digital twin of an IT service, injecting faults on the digital twin and evaluating how different service configuration and fault management strategies would perform from a business level perspective, ChaosTwin provides useful guidance to service providers in finding cost-effective service configurations that can minimize the negative effects of unpredictable events. Experimental results, collected from the evaluation of a realistic case study, demonstrate how ChaosTwin is capable of minimizing both the associated costs and the effects of injected Chaos faults.},

Digital twins provide previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies. Recently, agriculture has seen several technological advancements, but it is still unclear if this community is making an effort to adopt digital twins in its operations. In this work, we employ a mixed-method approach to investigate the added-value of digital twins for agriculture. We examine the extent of digital twin adoption in agriculture, shed light on the concept and the benefits it brings, and provide an application-based roadmap for a more extended adoption. We report a literature review of digital twins in agriculture, covering years 2017-2020. We identify 28 use cases, and compare them with use cases in other disciplines. We compare reported benefits, service categories, and technology readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture. We distill the digital twin characteristics that can provide added-value to agriculture from the examined digital twin applications in agriculture and in other disciplines. Then, inspired by digital twin applications in other disciplines, we propose a roadmap for digital twins in agriculture, consisting of examples of growing complexity. We conclude this paper by identifying the distinctive characteristics of agricultural digital twins.},

These services are typically deployed using Docker containers on cloud platforms. Container technology supports the deployment of these services with high portability, scalability, and performance, when compared to deploying them using virtual machines (i.e. VM-based services). It is widely known fact that container-based services give better performance than VM-based services. However, we show in this paper that services deployed using Amazon AWS ECS (EC2 Container Service) surprisingly perform significantly worse when compared with services deployed using Amazon EC2 VMs. We study and quantify the performance difference in terms of throughput, response time and CPU utilization considering different deployment scenarios.},

  abstract = {There is considerable pressure to define the key requirements of 5G, develop 5G standards, and perform technology trials as quickly as possible. Normally, these activities are best done in series but there is a desire to complete these tasks in parallel so that commercial deployments of 5G can begin by 2020. 5G will not be an incremental improvement over its predecessors; it aims to be a revolutionary leap forward in terms of data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. These capabilities are targeted at realizing high-speed connectivity, the Internet of Things, augmented virtual reality, the tactile internet, and so on. The requirements of 5G are expected to be met by new spectrum in the microwave bands (3.3-4.2 GHz), and utilizing large bandwidths available in mm-wave bands, increasing spatial degrees of freedom via large antenna arrays and 3-D MIMO, network densification, and new waveforms that provide scalability and flexibility to meet the varying demands of 5G services. Unlike the one size fits all 4G core networks, the 5G core network must be flexible and adaptable and is expected to simultaneously provide optimized support for the diverse 5G use case categories. In this paper, we provide an overview of 5G research, standardization trials, and deployment challenges. Due to the enormous scope of 5G systems, it is necessary to provide some direction in a tutorial article, and in this overview, the focus is largely user centric, rather than device centric. In addition to surveying the state of play in the area, we identify leading technologies, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, and outline the key challenges ahead, with research test beds delivering promising performance but pre-commercial trials lagging behind the desired 5G targets.},

  abstract = {Virtualization is used in data center and cloud environments to decouple applications from the hardware they run on. Hardware virtualization and operating system level virtualization are two prominent technologies that enable this. Containers, which use OS virtualization, have recently surged in interest and deployment. In this paper, we study the differences between the two virtualization technologies. We compare containers and virtual machines in large data center environments along the dimensions of performance, manageability and software development.We evaluate the performance differences caused by the different virtualization technologies in data center environments where multiple applications are running on the same servers (multi-tenancy). Our results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads. We also evaluate differences in the management frameworks which control deployment and orchestration of containers and VMs. We show how the different capabilities exposed by the two virtualization technologies can affect the management and development of applications. Lastly, we evaluate novel approaches which combine hardware and OS virtualization.},

Here, we quantify the changes in impact and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that impact, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist’s sequence of publications. This random-impact rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity, individual ability, and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success. The model assigns a unique individual parameter Q to each scientist, which is stable during a career, and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist’s impact, from the h-index to cumulative citations, and independent recognitions, such as prizes.}

  abstract = {The flexibility of future production systems envisioned by Industry 4.0 requires safe but efficient Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). An important enabler of HRC is a sophisticated collision avoidance mechanism which can detect objects and potential collision events and as a response, it calculates detour trajectories avoiding physical contacts. Digital twins provide a novel way to test the impact of different control decisions in a simulated virtual environment even in parallel. The required computational power can be provided by cloud platforms but at the cost of higher delay and jitter. Moreover, clouds bring a versatile set of novel techniques easing the life of both developers and operators. Can digital twins exploit the benefits of these concepts? Can the robots tolerate the delay characteristics coming with the cloud platforms? In this paper, we answer these questions by building on public and private cloud solutions providing different techniques for parallel computation. Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce a measurement methodology to characterize different approaches in terms of latency. Second, a real HRC use-case is elaborated and a relevant KPI is defined. Third, we evaluate the pros/cons of different solutions and their impact on the performance.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: Container orchestration frameworks provide support for management of complex distributed applications. Different frameworks have emerged only recently, and they have been in constant evolution as new features are being introduced. This reality makes it difficult for practitioners and researchers to maintain a clear view of the technology space. (2) Methods: we present a descriptive feature comparison study of the three most prominent orchestration frameworks: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos, which can be combined with Marathon, Aurora or DC/OS. This study aims at (i) identifying the common and unique features of all frameworks, (ii) comparing these frameworks qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to genericity in terms of supported features, and (iii) investigating the maturity and stability of the frameworks as well as the pioneering nature of each framework by studying the historical evolution of the frameworks on GitHub. (3) Results: (i) we have identified 124 common features and 54 unique features that we divided into a taxonomy of 9 functional aspects and 27 functional sub-aspects. (ii) Kubernetes supports the highest number of accumulated common and unique features for all 9 functional aspects; however, no evidence has been found for significant differences in genericity with Docker Swarm and DC/OS. (iii) Very little feature deprecations have been found and 15 out of 27 sub-aspects have been identified as mature and stable. These are pioneered in descending order by Kubernetes, Mesos, and Marathon. (4) Conclusion: there is a broad and mature foundation that underpins all container orchestration frameworks. Likely areas for further evolution and innovation include system support for improved cluster security and container security, performance isolation of GPU, disk and network resources, and network plugin architectures.},

  abstract = {Kubernetes (k8s) is a kind of cluster operating system for cloud-native workloads that has become a de-facto standard for container orchestration. Provided by more than one hundred vendors, it has the potential to protect the customer from vendor lock-in. However, the open-source k8s distribution consists of many optional and alternative features that must be explicitly activated and may depend on pre-configured system components. As a result, incompatibilities still may ensue among Kubernetes vendors. Mostly managed k8s services typically restrict the customizability of Kubernetes. This paper firstly compares the most relevant k8s vendors and, secondly, analyses the potential of Kubernetes to detect and configure compatible support for required features across vendors in a uniform manner. Our comparison is performed based on documented features, by testing, and by inspection of the configuration state of running clusters. Our analysis focuses on the potential of the end-to-end testing suite of Kubernetes to detect support for a desired feature in any Kubernetes vendor and the possibility of reconfiguring the studied vendors with missing features in a uniform manner. Our findings are threefold: First, incompatibilities arise between default cluster configurations of the studied vendors for approximately 18\% of documented features. Second, matching end-to-end tests exist only for around 64\% of features and for 17\% of features these matching tests are not well developed for all vendors. Third, almost all feature incompatibilities can be resolved using a vendor-agnostic API. These insights are beneficial to avoid feature incompatibilities already in cloud-native application engineering processes. Moreover, the end-to-end testing suite can be extended in currently unlighted areas to provide better feature coverage.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing provides new opportunities to deploy scalable application in an efficient way, allowing enterprise applications to dynamically adjust their computing resources on demand. In this paper we analyze and test the microservice architecture pattern, used during the last years by large Internet companies like Amazon, Netflix and LinkedIn to deploy large applications in the cloud as a set of small services that can be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, operated and upgraded independently, allowing these companies to gain agility, reduce complexity and scale their applications in the cloud in a more efficient way. We present a case study where an enterprise application was developed and deployed in the cloud using a monolithic approach and a microservice architecture using the Play web framework. We show the results of performance tests executed on both applications, and we describe the benefits and challenges that existing enterprises can get and face when they implement microservices in their applications. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Digital twins are digital representations of physical products or systems that consist of multiple models from various domains describing them on multiple scales. By means of communication, digital twins change and evolve together with their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle. Domain-specific partial models that make up the digital twin, such as the CAD model or the degradation model, are usually well known and provide accurate descriptions of certain parts of the physical asset. However, in complex systems, the value of integrating the partial models increases because it facilitates the study of their complex behaviours which only emerge from the interactions between various parts of the system. The paper proposes that the partial models of the digital twin share a common model space that integrates them through a definition of their interrelations and acts as a bridge between the digital twin and the physical asset. The approach is illustrated in a case of a mechatronic product - a differential drive mobile robot developed as a testbed for digital twin research. It is demonstrated how the integrated models add value to different stages of the lifecycle, allowing for evaluation of performance in the design stage and real-time reflection with the physical asset during its operation.},

In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60\% and 80\% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.},
